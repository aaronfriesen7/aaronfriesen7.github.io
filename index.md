Hi! I'm a computer engineering major at CSUF and this is my CPSC 120 Portfolio!

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6

I really enjoyed making this lab because the objective was making a primitive form of blackjack that can add the cards totals. Blackjack is one of my favorite card games and integrating it with what we are doing in CPSC 120 made it a lab to remember. Blackjack also brings back bad memories losing a lot of money but i mean hey, you win some you lose some and it’s still fun

Lab 10

This lab was a take home lab meant to be done over fall recess, and was meant to be solo. For this reason I really liked it, it forced me to think outside of the box because there was no one there to ask for help. It focused on for loops and object oriented classes and overall was very fun to figure out. It felt like a puzzle in a way

Lab 11

This lab felt difficult, dealing with 2D vectors which was a new concept at the time, but that difficulty made it more intriguing. Trying to work past those difficulties made finishing it that much more rewarding and all the worth. It also had object oriented classes, which was also a challenging subject that I didn’t fully understand at the time, which the lab helped to clarify.
